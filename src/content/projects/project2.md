An image-based website showcasing a holiday cottage in Llanbedrog. It is a lightweight brochure site, built with Astro for templating and styled with Tailwind. The website aims to give the user a good overview of the holiday cottage and the surrounding area, with an elegant and minimal design. It is intended to keep the user engaged without distraction, in order to provide an accurate representation of what it would be like to rent out the cottage.
