An information-heavy website built with Wordpress CMS for blog posting and user update support. The website incorporates design elements consistent with the NHS Digital guidelines, so that users feel familiarity and relation to other NHS sites. The goal of the site is to provide useful and relevant information or news to patients in the Chester area who can be served by the Chester South PCN, and impart support and guidance to that specific population.
